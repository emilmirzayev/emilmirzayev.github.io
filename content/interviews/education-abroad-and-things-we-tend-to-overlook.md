## Interview Overview

In this talk with Əkinçi, I discuss studying abroad, especially the things students often don't think about when they plan to study in another country. I compare the way teaching is done in Azerbaijan (which is like many Post-Soviet or Eastern systems) with how it's usually done in Western countries (like in Europe, North America, and also places like Japan or Korea). I stress how important it is to know about the different ways of studying, how students and professors talk to each other, and why it's necessary to prepare for more than just getting accepted.

## Key Points Covered

- I talk about how students focus a lot on getting accepted abroad but often don't prepare for the different way of learning there.
- I explain the difference between the *individual* focus in Western education (personal learning, respectful communication, building trust, treating students as individuals) and the *group* focus in places like Azerbaijan (teacher talks to the whole class, less one-on-one time, students might feel shy to speak up).
- I discuss how teachers are seen differently: in Azerbaijan/East, teachers are often seen as always right, which can stop students from disagreeing. In the West, students are usually encouraged to think for themselves, ask questions, and discuss ideas respectfully with professors.
- I mention the importance of the good relationship (`etibar koridoru` - trust corridor) between students and professors in the West, helping students learn better and feel more involved.
- I give practical tips for students facing study problems abroad: join student groups for help from others and talk directly to professors during their office hours.
- I point out that Western professors often admit when they don't know something, which builds trust, unlike in some systems where this might be seen badly.
- I explain two ways to choose a dissertation topic and supervisor: either pick a professor you like and see what projects they offer, or choose a topic you love first and then find a professor who knows about it.
- I emphasize that liking your dissertation topic is very important because it takes a lot of time and work.
- I talk about the common problem students from Azerbaijan/Post-Soviet areas have with academic writing (often seen in lower IELTS Writing scores) and connect it to not being asked for their opinions much in their previous schools.
- I suggest ways to get better at academic writing: read many academic papers, talk about ideas with others, and maybe use AI tools like ChatGPT carefully for feedback (but always double-check the information).

## Main Takeaways

To do well studying abroad, it's not just about getting in; you need to get used to a different way of learning. This often means taking part individually, thinking critically about what you learn, and talking openly and respectfully with teachers. Students should get ready by understanding these differences, practicing things like academic writing, and being ready to ask for help when needed. For big projects like a dissertation, it's really important to pick a topic you actually care about to stay motivated. You can find a supervisor either by joining a professor's research or by finding someone who can help with your own topic idea.
