## Overview

In this talk with Əkinçi, I discuss studying abroad, especially the things students often don't think about when they plan to study in another country. I stress how important it is to know about the different ways of studying, how students and professors communicate. The talk is in **Azerbaijani**, but **English subtitles** are available.
