## Overview

I talked about the **generative artificial intelligence models** and, importantly, their impact on **productivity**. I explained how these advanced models work â€“ basically, generating text, audio, video, or images based on instructions we give them. The conversation focused on how this technology could significantly boost the productivity of even highly skilled workers, the expected positive effects on the global economy, and also touched on the natural concerns people have about job security in this new era. The talk is in **Azerbaijani**, but **English subtitles** are available.
